CaseForOpenTraitData
====================

In two weeks the organsiers of the [TRY trait database](http://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/) are meeting to discuss the future of TRY. Try has been tremendously successful in bringing together trait data from many different sources, and we are extremely grateful for this. However, many people (including us) also have concerns about the model of data sharing TRY currently operates under.

The purpose of this document is to describe some of the alternative models that might be considered, with an overall focus on
- reproducibility
- open access
- usability.

Contributions are welcome, to help make a persuasive case for open trait data. We should aim to be as constructive as possible, recognising all the positive energy and effort that has gone into creating TRY, while also providing a vision for what it might be.
