The Case For An Open Access Trait Database
====================

In the first week of September, members of the [TRY trait database](http://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/) consortium are meeting to discuss the future of TRY. Currently, TRY includes over 3 million trait records for about 69000 plant species, with contributions from 372 participants from 179 scientific institutes worldwide. This collaborative effort is a fantastic achievement that can rightly be celebrated. At the same time, many people both within and outside the TRY group believe the model of data sharing currently adopted by TRY is unnecessarily restrictive, and even detrimental to TRY's broader mission of moving forward with important research questions.

One of the issues slated for discussion at the September meeting is whether TRY should move to a more open access model of data distribution.

The purpose of this document is to outline the potential benefits of moving to a fully open access model of data sharing within ecology and share ideas on how this could be achieved. We understand that such a shift might pose significant infrastructural and political challenges. Yet, we strongly believe that an open model is in the public's best interests and would vastly increase the ability of trait-based research to solve key questions in ecology, evolution and conservation. Thus, while recognising the great things TRY has achieved, we encourage the members of TRY to take the next step, by moving towards an open model of data contribution and usage. We are certain any challenges that arise in moving to an open model could be overcome, if only the community were to embrace the vision of an open-access model.

Contributions to this document are welcome, but should be constructive, recognising all the positive energy and effort that has gone into creating TRY, while also providing a vision for what it might become. The general aim is to make a persuasive case for an open trait database. Even if the organisers of TRY decide not to move towards an open access model, this document may help inspire others to take on the general challenges raised in this and other areas of science.

Many people have already thought and written about the benefits of open access models. Thus the purpose of this document is simply to summarise the different arguments and point to relevant literature for the upcoming discussion at hand.

# Key reasons why we should support a fully open model of data sharing in ecology

## Accelerating science

We are all united by a joint goal to discover key facts about the natural world and address the challenges posed by environmental change and human impact. As Michael Nielsen argues in this great TED talk : [Open science now!](http://bit.ly/18QNFEv),  we can accelerate scientific discovery through open exchange of data, code, and ideas.  As Michael explains, when a field becomes more open, it can move forward very quickly. There is also evidence to suggest that the research impact of papers with open data is considerably higher, e.g.

- Piwowar et al. (2007) Sharing Detailed Research Data Is Associated with Increased Citation Rate. [DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000308](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308)
- The [global wood density database](http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.235), published as an open access dataset on datadyad, has now been downloaded over 5700 times.

Funding agencies have also recognised the value of making data open, so increasingly are requiring data collected with public money to be made publicly available, as described [here](TO DO - add links examples).

## Transparency and reproducibility

At the same time, there is  a move towards making journal publications more reproducible and transparent. From the perspective of reproducible science, the ideal paper would include as supplementary material, all the data and code used in the analyses, so that reviewers and readers can reproduce the results of a a paper and evaluate the evidence for themselves. High profile journals such as Nature now require data to be made available, as do a wide range of top-rating journals in evolutionary biology [(Whitlock 2010)](http://doi.org/10.1086/650340).

## The moral arguments

### Public money = public data
As research scientists, most of us are funded by public money. Thus our data is also arguably also public. It is undeniably in the public's greater good that we scientists make our data public, once we have published the research for which we were initially funded.

### Built on the generosity of others

Some of the trait data in TRY has been compiled from the literature, using data that was made freely available by the original collectors. Honouring the good will of the original data collectors, such compilations should also be made public with the relevant publications. We are confident that many people would continue to contribute to open databases, where it was evident that it such contributions would be honoured by equivalent levels of openness.

An analogous situation exists in the world of open source software. For example, the GNU public license offers free use of computer source code, provided derived products are also made open source.

### Tit-for-tat
Trait ecologists routinely use a whole suite of open data resources, including:

- genetic sequence data
- climate data
- soils data
- distribution data, from source such as GBIF
- phylogenetic trees
- forest inventory data
- taxonomic information
- remote sensing data.

In addition, ecologists benefit from a wide range of open tools such as statistical packages, especially in R.

All of these resources are provided without obligation and allow scientists to achieve far more than might otherwise be possible. Ecological data has same potential.  It remains unclear why trait data should be considered any different to these other tools.

For our part, the contributors to this article has provided a wide range of open source tools and data sets, including

- trait data:
- software packages: Yplant, smatr software

### Tragedy of the commons
In early 2000's many trait datasets were provided in appendices to papers. Examples

- [Falster et al 2005]( http://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2005.00992.x)

This type of activity is discouraged under the current model of data sharing in TRY. If people perceive a perceived benefit of keeping data closed (in the hope of future co-authorship on papers), they may be less likely to share data.

Moreover, closed data models, where co-authorship is offered to data contributors, increase the competitiveness in field and thus the relentless drive towards higher publication number in recruitment processes. This is something almost all ecologists dislike, yet many are actively making the situation worse.

# Common concerns about open access models

## Openness is bad for my career

Examples to counter this

- Amy Zanne's wood density database most downloaded resource on datadryad. has had very positive effects on her career, as explained in this [recent communication in Nature](http://doi.org/10.1038/nj7461-243a).

## That data was hard to collect and I don't want to give it away

yes, but a lot of data is lost due to changing technology.

## We need to protect the vulnerable PhD students
